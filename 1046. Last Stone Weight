1046. Last Stone Weight

We have a collection of rocks, each rock has a positive integer weight.  
Each turn, we choose the two heaviest rocks and smash them together.  
Suppose the stones have weights x and y with x <= y.  The result of this smash is:  If x == y, 
both stones are totally destroyed; If x != y, the stone of weight x is totally destroyed, 
and the stone of weight y has new weight y-x. At the end, there is at most 1 stone left.  
Return the weight of this stone (or 0 if there are no stones left.)

class Solution {
    public int lastStoneWeight(int[] stones) {
     List<Integer> list = new ArrayList();
        for (int i : stones){
            list.add(i);
        }
        
        int temp = 0;
        while (list.size()>1){
            Collections.sort(list);
            temp = list.get(list.size()-1)- list.get(list.size()-2);
            list.remove(list.size()-1);
            list.remove(list.size()-1);
            list.add(temp);
            
        }
        return list.get(0);
        
    }
}
