771. jewels and stones
You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have.  
Each character in S is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.  
The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters. 
Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

class Solution {
    public int numJewelsInStones(String J, String S) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0 ; i < S.length(); i++){
            for (int j = 0 ; j < J.length(); j ++){
                if (S.charAt(i) == J.charAt(j)){
                    count++;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
