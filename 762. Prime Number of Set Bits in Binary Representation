762. Prime Number of Set Bits in Binary Representation
Given two integers L and R, find the count of numbers in the range [L, R] (inclusive) having a prime number of set bits in 
their binary representation.  (Recall that the number of set bits an integer has is the number of 1s present 
when written in binary. For example, 21 written in binary is 10101 which has 3 set bits. Also, 1 is not a prime.)

class Solution {
    public int countPrimeSetBits(int L, int R) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i =L; i <=R; i++){
            if (isPrimeSet(Integer.bitCount(i))){
                count++;
            }
        
        }
        return count;
    }
    
    public boolean isPrimeSet(int x){
  
       return (x == 2 || x == 3 || x == 5 || x == 7 ||
                x == 11 || x == 13 || x == 17 || x == 19);
    }
}
