11. container with most water
Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). 
n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, 
which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.
class Solution {
    public int maxArea(int[] height) {
        int start = 0;
        int end = height.length -1;
        int max = 0;
        while (start < end){
            int num = (end-start) * Math.min(height[start], height[end]);
            if (num > max){
                max = num;
