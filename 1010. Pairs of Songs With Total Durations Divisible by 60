1010. Pairs of Songs With Total Durations Divisible by 60
In a list of songs, the i-th song has a duration of time[i] seconds.   Return the number of pairs of songs for which their total duration
in seconds is divisible by 60.  Formally, we want the number of indices i < j with (time[i] + time[j]) % 60 == 0.
class Solution {
    public int numPairsDivisibleBy60(int[] time) {
        Map <Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap();
        int sum = 0;
        for (int num : time){
            for (int key : map.keySet()){
                if ((key + num)%60==0){
                    sum+= map.get(key);
                }
            }
            if (map.get(num) ==null){
                map.put(num,1);
            }else{
                map.put(num, map.get(num)+1);
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
