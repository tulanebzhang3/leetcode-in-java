925. Long Pressed Name
Your friend is typing his name into a keyboard.  Sometimes, when typing a character c, the key might get long pressed,
and the character will be typed 1 or more times.  You examine the typed characters of the keyboard.  
Return True if it is possible that it was your friends name, with some characters (possibly none) being long pressed.
