200. Number of Islands
Given a 2d grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of islands. An island is surrounded by water and is 
formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded
by water.
class Solution {
    public int numIslands(char[][] grid) {
        if(grid.length ==0 || grid[0].length ==0 ){return 0;}
        int num = 0;
        for( int i = 0; i< grid.length; i++){
            for (int j = 0 ; j< grid[0].length; j++){
                if(grid[i][j] == '1'){
                    num++;
                    helper(grid,i,j);
                        
                }
            }
        }
        return num;
        
    }
    
    public void helper(char[][] grid, int i, int j ){
        if (grid[i][j] == '0'){
            return;
        } else{
            grid[i][j] ='0';
            if( i>0 ) { helper(grid, i-1,j);}
            if( i< grid.length-1) { helper(grid, i+1, j);}
            if( j>0) {helper( grid, i,j-1);}
            if(j < grid[0].length-1){helper(grid, i, j+1);}
        }
    }
}
