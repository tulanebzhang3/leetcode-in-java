788. Rotated Digits
X is a good number if after rotating each digit individually by 180 degrees, we get a valid number that is different from X. 
Each digit must be rotated - we cannot choose to leave it alone.  A number is valid if each digit remains a digit after
rotation. 0, 1, and 8 rotate to themselves; 2 and 5 rotate to each other; 6 and 9 rotate to each other,
and the rest of the numbers do not rotate to any other number and become invalid.  Now given a positive number N,
how many numbers X from 1 to N are good?

class Solution {
    public int rotatedDigits(int N) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i<=N; i++){
            if (isRotated(i)){
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
    
    public boolean isRotated(int num){
        boolean flag = false;
        String s = num+"";
        for (char c: s.toCharArray()){
            if (c=='3' || c=='4' || c=='7'){
                return false;
            }
            if (c=='2'||c=='5' || c=='6' || c=='9'){
                flag = true;
            }
        }
        return flag;
    }
}
