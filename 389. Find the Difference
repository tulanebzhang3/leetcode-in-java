389. Find the Difference
Given two strings s and t which consist of only lowercase letters. 
String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.  
Find the letter that was added in t.

class Solution {
    public char findTheDifference(String s, String t) {
        char answer = 'a';
        char [] c1 = s.toCharArray();
        char [] c2 = t.toCharArray();
        int [] arr = new int [26];
        for (char c : c1){
            arr[c-'a']++;
        }
        for (char c: c2){
            arr[c-'a']--;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i< arr.length; i++){
            if (arr[i] != 0){
                answer = (char)(i+'a');
            }
        }
        return answer;
    }
