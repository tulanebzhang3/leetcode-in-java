1165. Single-Row Keyboard
There is a special keyboard with all keys in a single row.  Given a string keyboard of length 26 indicating the layout of the
keyboard (indexed from 0 to 25), initially your finger is at index 0. To type a character, you have to move your finger to 
the index of the desired character. The time taken to move your finger from index i to index j is |i - j|.  You want to type 
a string word. Write a function to calculate how much time it takes to type it with one finger.
class Solution {
    public int calculateTime(String keyboard, String word) {
        Map<Character, Integer> map = new HashMap();
        int index = 0;
        for (char ch : keyboard.toCharArray()){
            map.put(ch, index);
            index++;
        }
        int answer = map.get(word.charAt(0));
        for (int i = 0; i< word.length()-1; i++){
            answer += Math.abs(map.get(word.charAt(i+1))-map.get(word.charAt(i)));
        }
        return answer;
    }
}
