441. Arranging Coins
You have a total of n coins that you want to form in a staircase shape, where every k-th row must have exactly k coins.  Given n, 
find the total number of full staircase rows that can be formed.  n is a non-negative integer and fits within the range of a 32-bit signed 
integer.
class Solution {
    public int arrangeCoins(int n) {
        if(n==0){return 0;}
        int index = 1;
        while(n >=index){
            n-= index;
            index ++;
        }
        return index-1;
    }
}
