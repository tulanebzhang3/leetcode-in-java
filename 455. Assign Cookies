455. Assign Cookies
Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, 
you should give each child at most one cookie. Each child i has a greed factor gi,
which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie j has a size sj. If sj >= gi, 
we can assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i will be content. 
Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.
class Solution {
    public int findContentChildren(int[] g, int[] s) {
        int sum = 0;
        Arrays.sort(g);
        Arrays.sort(s);
        int i = 0, j= 0;
        while(i< g.length && j < s.length){
            if (g[i]<= s[j]){
                sum++;
                i++;
                j++;
            }else{
                j++;
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
