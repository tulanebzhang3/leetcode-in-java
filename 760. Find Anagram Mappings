760. Find Anagram Mappings
Given two lists Aand B, and B is an anagram of A. B is an anagram of A means B is made by randomizing the order of the 
elements in A.  We want to find an index mapping P, from A to B. A mapping P[i] = j means the ith element in A appears in B 
at index j.  These lists A and B may contain duplicates. If there are multiple answers, output any of them.
class Solution {
    public int[] anagramMappings(int[] A, int[] B) {
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap();
        for (int i = 0; i< B.length; i++){
            map.put(B[i],i);
        }
        int[] result = new int[A.length];
        for (int i = 0; i< A.length; i++){
            result [i] = map.get(A[i]);
        }
        return result;
    }
}
