274. h-index
Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's 
h-index.  According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations
each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."
class Solution {
    public int hIndex(int[] citations) {
        if( citations.length==0){return 0;}
        Arrays.sort(citations);
        int num = 0;
        for(int i = citations.length-1; i>=0; i--){
            if (citations[i] > num){
                num++;
            }
        }
        return num;
    }
}
