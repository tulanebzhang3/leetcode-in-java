509. Fibonacci Number
The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, 
such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is,  F(0) = 0,   
F(1) = 1 F(N) = F(N - 1) + F(N - 2), for N > 1. Given N, calculate F(N).

class Solution {
    public int fib(int N) {
        int [] fibarr = new int[N+1];
        fibarr[0]=0;
        if (N>0){fibarr[1] =1;
        for (int i=2; i< fibarr.length; i++){
            fibarr[i]= fibarr[i-2] + fibarr[i-1];
            
        }}
        
        return fibarr[N];
    }
}
