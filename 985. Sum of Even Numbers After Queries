985. Sum of Even Numbers After Queries
We have an array A of integers, and an array queries of queries.  For the i-th query val = queries[i][0], 
index = queries[i][1], we add val to A[index].  Then, the answer to the i-th query is the sum of the even values of A.  
(Here, the given index = queries[i][1] is a 0-based index, and each query permanently modifies the array A.) 
Return the answer to all queries.  Your answer array should have answer[i] as the answer to the i-th query.

class Solution {
    public int[] sumEvenAfterQueries(int[] A, int[][] queries) {
        int [] sum = new int [A.length];
        int temp = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < A.length; i++){
       A[queries[i][1]] += queries[i][0];
           for (int a : A){
               if (a%2==0){
                   temp += a;
               }
           }
        sum[i] = temp;
            temp = 0;
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
