202. Happy Number
Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".  A happy number is a number defined by the following process: 
Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, 
and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers
class Solution {
    public boolean isHappy(int n) {
        Set<Integer> set = new HashSet();
        boolean flag = true;
        set.add(n);
        while(n!=1){
            n = digitSum(n);
            if (set.contains(n)){
                flag = false;
                break;
            } else{
                set.add(n);
            }
                
        }
        return flag;
                                
    }
    
    public int digitSum(int num){
        int sum = 0;
        while (num!=0){
            int digit = num%10;
            sum += digit *digit;
            num/=10;
        }
        
        return sum;
    }
}
