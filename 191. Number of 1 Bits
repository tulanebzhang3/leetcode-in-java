191. Number of 1 Bits
Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and return the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).
public class Solution {
    // you need to treat n as an unsigned value
    public int hammingWeight(int n) {
        int count = 0;
        int m = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i< 32 ; i++){
            if ((m & n) != 0 ){
                count++;
            }
            m<<=1;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
