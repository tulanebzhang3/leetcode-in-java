70. Climbing Stairs
You are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach to the top.  Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. 
In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?  Note: Given n will be a positive integer.
class Solution {
    public int climbStairs(int n) {
        if (n ==1){ return 1;}
        if (n==0){return 0;}
        int [] arr = new int [n+1];
        arr[1] =1;
        arr[2] =2;
        for (int i =3; i<=n; i++){
            arr[i] = arr[i-2] + arr[i-1];
        }
        return arr[n];
    }
}
